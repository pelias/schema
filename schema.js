    /**
      these `_type`s are created when the index is created, while all other `_type`
      are dynamically created as required at run time, this served two purposes:

      1) creating at least one _type will avoid errors when searching against
         an empty database. Having at least one _type means that 0 documents are
         returned instead of a error from elasticsearch.

      2) allows us to define their analysis differently from the other `_type`s.
         in this case, we will elect to use the $oneGramMapping so that these
         _type can be searched with a single character. doing so on *all* _type
         would result in much larger indeces and decreased search performance.
